# Implementation Notes - IMPORTANT

## ⚠️ Integration Issues Found

### 1. Router Not Integrated
The `app/router.py` file contains many implemented endpoints but is **NOT imported** into `main_direct.py`. This means these endpoints are NOT available:

- POST `/calibrate/batch` - Batch processing
- Various cache management endpoints
- Advanced job filtering endpoints

**To Fix:**
```python
# In main_direct.py, add:
from .router import router as api_router
app.include_router(api_router, prefix="/api", tags=["calibration"])
```

### 2. Batch Processing Not Working
While batch processing code exists in:
- `app/job_endpoints.py` - Implementation
- `app/router.py` - Endpoints
- Tests written for it

It's not accessible because router.py isn't imported.

### 3. Some Async Features Incomplete
Several async components were created but not fully integrated:
- `calibration_service.py` - Service layer exists but partially used
- `redis_pubsub.py` - Pub/sub system created but not fully integrated
- `config.py` - Configuration system not fully utilized

## 📋 To Complete Integration:

1. **Import the router** in main_direct.py:
```python
from .router import router as api_router
app.include_router(api_router)
```

2. **Fix import errors** - Some modules may have circular dependencies or missing imports

3. **Test the integration** - After importing router, test all endpoints

4. **Update documentation** - Once integrated, update README with correct endpoints

## 🔍 Current Working Endpoints:

These endpoints ARE working in main_direct.py:
- GET `/` - Health check ✓
- POST `/calibrate` - Main calibration (sync/async) ✓
- GET `/datasets` ✓
- GET `/datasets/{id}/preview` ✓
- POST `/convert/causes` ✓
- POST `/validate` ✓
- GET `/cause-mappings/{age_group}` ✓
- GET `/supported-configurations` ✓
- GET `/example-data` ✓
- POST `/jobs/calibrate` ✓
- GET `/jobs/{job_id}` ✓
- GET `/jobs` ✓
- GET `/jobs/{job_id}/output` ✓
- POST `/jobs/{job_id}/cancel` ✓
- DELETE `/jobs/{job_id}` ✓
- POST `/calibrate/realtime` ✓
- GET `/calibrate/{job_id}/status` ✓
- GET `/websocket/stats` ✓
- WebSocket `/ws/calibrate/{job_id}/logs` ✓

## 🚫 NOT Working (Need Integration):

These exist in code but aren't accessible:
- POST `/calibrate/batch` - Batch processing
- Cache management endpoints
- Advanced filtering options
- Some configuration endpoints

## Recommendation:

The implementation is **mostly complete** but needs final integration step. The agents created all the components but didn't fully wire them together in main_direct.py.
